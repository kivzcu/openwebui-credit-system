echo "üìã QUICK START:"
echo "==============="
echo ""
echo "1. Run the credit system:"
echo "   cd credit_admin"
echo "   ENABLE_SSL=true python app/main.py"
echo ""
echo "2. Access admin interface:"
echo "   https://localhost:8000"
echo "   Username: admin"
echo "   Password: admin123 (‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE THIS!)"
echo ""
echo "3. Configure OpenWebUI extensions with these environment variables:"
echo "   CREDITS_API_PROTOCOL=https"
echo "   CREDITS_API_HOST=localhost:8000"
echo "   CREDITS_API_SSL_VERIFY=false"
echo "   CREDITS_API_KEY=<key_shown_when_app_starts>"
echo ""

echo "üîë SECURITY CHECKLIST:"
echo "======================"
echo ""
echo "[ ] Change default admin password"
echo "[ ] Generate unique SECRET_KEY"
echo "[ ] Generate unique CREDITS_API_KEY"
echo "[ ] Configure OpenWebUI extensions with API key"
echo "[ ] Test admin login functionality"
echo "[ ] Test extension API access"
echo "[ ] Verify HTTPS is working"
echo "[ ] Review security logs"

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:"
echo "=========================="
echo ""
echo "Before deploying to production:"
echo "1. Use valid SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)"
echo "2. Change ALL default passwords and keys"
echo "3. Configure firewall (ports 80, 443 only)"
echo "4. Set up monitoring and log alerts"
