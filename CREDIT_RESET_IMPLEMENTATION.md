# Credit Reset System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented an automated monthly credit reset system that integrates directly into the main application using async primitives. The system replaces the old JSON-based approach with a robust database-driven solution.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **New Table**: `credit_reset_tracking` to track all reset events
- **Columns**: 
  - `reset_type` (monthly, manual, etc.)
  - `reset_date` (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - `reset_timestamp` (full timestamp)
  - `users_affected` (count of users reset)
  - `total_credits_reset` (total credits distributed)
  - `status` (completed, failed, pending)
  - `error_message` (for failed resets)
  - `metadata` (JSON for additional data)
- **Indexes**: Optimized for date and type queries

### 2. Database Methods Added
```python
# Core reset tracking methods
def record_reset_event()      # Record reset attempts/completions
def get_last_reset_date()     # Get last successful reset date
def get_reset_history()       # Get history of all resets
def needs_monthly_reset()     # Check if reset is needed
def perform_monthly_reset()   # Execute the monthly reset
```

### 3. Application Integration (main.py)
- **Startup Check**: Automatic reset check when application starts
- **Background Task**: Continuous async task checking every hour
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of background tasks
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for all reset operations

### 4. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/reset/status` - Get current reset status and history
- `POST /api/reset/manual` - Manually trigger a monthly reset
- Enhanced health check endpoint

### 5. Error Handling & Logging
- Database transaction safety
- Comprehensive error logging
- Failed reset attempt tracking
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Reset Flow
1. **Startup**: Application checks if reset is needed immediately
2. **Background Task**: Every hour, check `needs_monthly_reset()`
3. **Monthly Check**: Compare last reset date with current month
4. **Reset Execution**: If needed, reset all users to their group default credits
5. **Logging**: Record the reset event in database and logs
6. **Transaction Safety**: All operations wrapped in database transactions

### Manual Reset Flow
1. **API Call**: POST to `/api/reset/manual`
2. **Validation**: Check if reset is actually needed (can be bypassed)
3. **Execution**: Same process as automatic reset
4. **Response**: Return detailed results of the operation

## 📊 Reset Logic Details

### When Reset Is Needed
- No previous reset recorded for monthly type
- Last monthly reset was in a previous month
- Uses timezone-aware date comparisons

### Reset Process
1. Get all users with valid group assignments
2. For each user with a group that has `default_credits > 0`:
   - Update user balance to group's default credits
   - Record transaction in `credit_transactions`
   - Track reset statistics
3. Record overall reset event in `credit_reset_tracking`
4. Log success/failure in system logs

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Data Integrity
- Database transactions ensure consistency
- Failed resets are recorded with error details
- No partial resets (all-or-nothing approach)

### Monitoring
- All reset events logged with timestamps
- API endpoints for monitoring reset status
- Background task status tracking
- Comprehensive error reporting

### Flexibility
- Configurable check intervals (currently 1 hour)
- Support for different reset types (monthly, manual, etc.)
- Metadata storage for future extensibility

## 🚀 Benefits Over Previous System

### Reliability
- ✅ Database-driven instead of file-based
- ✅ Automatic execution without external dependencies
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- ✅ Transaction safety and data consistency

### Monitoring & Auditing
- ✅ Complete reset history tracking
- ✅ Detailed logging of all operations
- ✅ API endpoints for status monitoring
- ✅ Failed attempt tracking with error details

### Integration
- ✅ Native integration with FastAPI application
- ✅ Uses existing async infrastructure
- ✅ No external scheduler dependencies
- ✅ Graceful startup and shutdown handling

### Maintainability
- ✅ Clean, well-documented code
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Extensible design for future enhancements
- ✅ Type hints and comprehensive logging

## 📈 Operational Status

The system is now fully operational and will:
- ✅ Check for needed resets every hour
- ✅ Automatically reset credits on the 1st of each month
- ✅ Log all reset activities for auditing
- ✅ Provide API access for manual operations
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully with proper logging
- ✅ Maintain complete reset history in the database

## 🎯 Next Steps

The credit reset system is complete and ready for production use. The old external scheduler files have been removed, and the system now operates entirely within the main application using modern async patterns.

All reset events are properly logged and tracked, providing full auditing capabilities and ensuring reliable monthly credit resets without manual intervention.
